# Choosing a React Starter kit

_General guide for choosing a starter kit (aka starter library, aka boilerplate) that's right for you._

## Introduction

This post will dive choosing a starter kit, using my experience building this blog as an example. I hope that this is the first post in a series that come out of working on this website.

Since this is my first post, I'll give some context about my experience. Coming into this, I've worked with React and TypeScript for about 5 years. I've been working in web development professionally for the past 10 years. My career has spanned finance, ed-tech, ad-tech, and currently internet security, as well as some freelancing.

I've typically been a full-stack engineer, usually focusing on front-end and user experience, and that is where I hope I can provide a helping hand.

With that, let's (yarn?) start!

## Why choose a starter kit at all?

There's value in building an application from scratch, particularly for gaining valuable learning experience as you go, and to be able to specify exactly what you want, and nothing else.

However, a starter kit does a lot of heavy lifting for you out of the box and is usually a way to hit the ground running. When my team first picked up React, we went with a starter kit which abstracted a lot of the complexity away from us, and we were able to focus on building the application and not worry (as much) about tooling.

## How to choose a starter kit

I've gone through this process a handful of times, so at this point I think it may be helpful to others (and future me) to document what I look for, what I avoid, and what I do after making a decision. These factors are mainly about the dependencies that are included, because you're going to change the content of the application anyways.

Luckily, it's not too hard to try a few different options before settling on one, and future you (or your team) will thank present you for making a good decision.

### What to look for

- Up to date dependencies
- Good tooling
- Preferably, officially supported

#### Up to Date Dependencies

When looking for a starter kit in the past, I came across _a lot_ of options. After digging into them a bit, I found that most of them were using outdated major dependencies.

By checking before I started I avoided some headache down the road. If I had went with an outdated template, I would have to rely on old documentation, I'd likely miss out on useful functionality, and ultimately I'd have to update dependencies myself.

Realistically, I'm going to update dependencies anyways; but jumping to newer minor or patch versions will have fewer breaking changes than having to upgrade major versions).

#### Good Tooling

By "tooling", I am essentially referring to specific dev dependencies. You'll likely want things like formatting, linting, and testing systems in place eventually. so you may as well get a starter kit that already has them integrated for you. Each of these will have its own options to choose from (like formatting rules), so picking a starting kit that has these out-of-the-box will mean they will work with each other (for example: eslint, Prettier, and TypeScript configurations working seamlessly together).

#### Officially Supported

With the above points in mind, look at official starter kits first. They are going to be more general, and not something that was created for a specific use case in the past. They'll also be more up-to-date, and in some cases have a built-in way to update itself.

### Conclusion

With these points in mind, I picked [with-typescript-eslint-jest](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-typescript-eslint-jest) for Next.JS.

This was one of the options using the installer (`create next-app`), and although some dependencies were a bit outdated, it looked like a good base. ESLint, Prettier, Jest and react-testing-library were all included, and there were a few bare-bone files (including tests!) that I start with.

My next post will go into what I did next.
