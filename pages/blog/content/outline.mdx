# Building a Blog (Part 1?)

## Getting start with Next.js and TypeScript

_Outlining the steps to build this blog, as I do them!_

This first post will dive into my process building a personal blog using Next.js and TypeScript.

Since this is my first post, I'll give some context about my experience. Coming into this, I've worked with React
and TypeScript for about 5 years. I've been working in web development professionally for the past 10 years. My career
has spanned finance, ed-tech, ad-tech, and currently internet security (at Dashlane), as well as some freelancing.

I've typically been a full-stack engineer, usually focusing on front-end and user experience, and that is where I hope
I can provide a helping hand.

With that, let's (yarn?) start (using the [Next.js docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started) as a reference).

`yarn create next-app` seems like a very accessible starting point.

After naming my project, I pick an "Example from the Next.js repo": `with-typescript-eslint-jest`.

I chose it for a few reasons:

- I like TypeScript, and I feel that existing docs and blogs under-represent it. I want to help with that!
- There's no reason to not include eslint. Hopefully Prettier is included too.
- I don't know how much unit testing I'll be doing, but I may as well have jest ready to go.TypeScript
- Other examples have other features I may want in the future (for example, styled-components) but I'll keep it simple.

Looking at a new codebase, I typically start with its `package.json`. It will outline the application at a very high
level: the tech stack (we already know this is React and TypeScript, but anything else interesting?), the build and
deployment, and development commands, and can help reduce "unknown unknowns".

A few things pop out:

- `prettier` is indeed included, so I tailor the `.prettierrc` file to my preferences and set up my IDE (WebStorm) to
  automatically format files when they are saved.
- `next: latest`. I change this to the latest major version (^9.4.3) because I want to avoid breaking changes.
