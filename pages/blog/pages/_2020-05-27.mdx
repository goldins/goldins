Title: Building a Blog

# Building a Blog (Part 1?)
## Getting start with Next.js and TypeScript

_Outlining the steps to build this blog, as I do them!_

This first post will dive into my process building a personal blog using Next.js and TypeScript.

Since this is my first post, I'll give some context about my experience. Coming into this, I've worked with React
and TypeScript for about 5 years. I've been working in web development professionally for the past 10 years. My career
has spanned finance, ed-tech, ad-tech, and currently internet security (at Dashlane), as well as some freelancing.

I've typically been a full-stack engineer, usually focusing on front-end and user experience, and that is where I hope
I can provide a helping hand.

With that, let's (yarn?) start (using the [Next.js docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started) as a reference).

`yarn create next-app` seems like a very accessible starting point.

After naming my project, I pick an "Example from the Next.js repo":  `with-typescript-eslint-jest`.
